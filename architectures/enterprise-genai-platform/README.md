# Secure Enterprise Generative AI Platform

## Objective

Define a reference architecture for deploying generative AI within a financial institution
while preserving accountability, least privilege, regulatory compliance, and auditability.

## Architectural Principles

- AI systems are treated as security principals
- All access is explicitly authorized at runtime
- Policy enforcement is centralized and auditable
- AI governance integrates with existing IAM and GRC processes

## Architecture Overview

[Diagram to be added]

## Key Components

- AI Identity Layer
- Policy Enforcement Point
- Model Access Gateway
- Tool and Data Access Mediation
- Observability and Audit Layer
- Governance Integration

## Why This Matters

This architecture addresses structural control gaps that emerge when AI systems
operate outside traditional application and identity governance models.
