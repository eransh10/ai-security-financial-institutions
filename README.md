# ai-security-financial-institutions
This repository documents reference architectures, threat models, and governance considerations for securing generative AI and AI agent systems in regulated financial institutions.

The core premise is simple:
AI systems operating in banks are becoming actors, not tools.
Actors require identity, authorization, lifecycle governance, and auditability.

Most existing AI security approaches focus on models and data leakage.
This repository focuses on the missing control plane:
identity and governance for enterprise AI.

## What This Repository Covers

- Reference architectures for secure enterprise GenAI platforms
- Identity and access management models for AI agents
- Threat models for AI systems operating in regulated environments
- Mapping of AI security controls to regulatory expectations

## What This Repository Is Not

- A collection of AI tutorials
- Vendor-specific guidance
- Production-ready implementations

## Intended Audience

- Security architects in financial services
- IAM and platform engineering leaders
- Risk, compliance, and audit professionals
- CISOs evaluating enterprise AI adoption
